## Setup
1. Unzip the latest release to your ~/Documents/Musescore4/Plugins directory.

2. In [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) click Settings > Interface > Enable HTTP web interface. Check the box for HTTP web interface and set the password to "Test" (or your own password if you change it in VLC Sync Micro.qml).

Enable the plugin in MuseScore Studio under Plugins > Manage plugins. Click the plugin and click Enable. Perhaps set a shortcut in Preferences > Shortcuts. (I use Cmd+Shift+M.) Load a score and open the plugin with the shortcut or under Plugins > Playback. In the Micro window, set an offset if needed.

At this time, VLC doesn't support timecode so playback sync won't be frame accurate.
